# 📊 E-Commerce Sales Dashboard

A comprehensive Power BI dashboard analyzing sales performance, profitability, and operational efficiency across a multi-year e-commerce dataset. Built to identify revenue drivers, pinpoint margin leakage, and guide strategic decision-making.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This dashboard transforms 9,994 transaction records (2014-2017) into actionable insights across four key dimensions:
- **Sales Performance**: Revenue trends, growth patterns, and customer segmentation
- **Product Analysis**: Category profitability, and discount impact
- **Regional Intelligence**: Geographic distribution, margin variance, and operational efficiency
- **Customer Insights**: High-value account identification, churn risk, and lifetime value

**Key Finding**: While revenue grew 51% over 4 years, 18.7% of orders are loss-making due to aggressive discounting (30%+), with the Central region showing the weakest margins (7.92%) despite high discount rates (15.5%).

## 💼 Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Fix the Discount Problem (Highest Impact)
**Issue**: Discounts above 30% are universally unprofitable  
**Action**: Implement hard cap at 25% discount; require VP approval for exceptions  
**Expected Impact**: Eliminate loss-making orders, improve margin by 2-3 percentage points

### 2. Central Region Intervention
**Issue**: 15.5% discount rate with only 7.92% margin (47% worse than West)  
**Action**: Audit Central's discount approval process; implement regional discount targets  
**Expected Impact**: Closing half the margin gap to company average = +$38K annual profit

### 3. Product Portfolio Optimization
**Issue**: Tables, Bookcases, and Supplies are net-negative  
**Action**: Eliminate discounts on these categories; consider discontinuing worst-performing SKUs  
**Expected Impact**: +$22K profit recovery

### 4. Replicate Home Office Success
**Issue**: Consumer segment (50% of revenue) has weakest margin (11.55%)  
**Action**: Analyze Home Office buying patterns; promote high-margin products to Consumer segment  
**Expected Impact**: 2 percentage point margin improvement on $1.2M = +$24K profit

### 5. High-Risk Account Review
**Issue**: Sean Miller ($25K revenue, -$2K profit) represents worst customer profile  
**Action**: Review contract terms; implement minimum margin thresholds for large accounts  
**Expected Impact**: Convert loss to break-even = +$2K per problematic account
